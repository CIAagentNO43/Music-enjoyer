  <b>Shame is no shame [UNFINISHED]</b>
    <br> <sup>Note:I don't really listen to the lyrics of my music. Just everything else.</sup>
   Shame is a British post-hardcore band made up of Charlie Steen (vocals), Eddie Green (guitar), Sean Coyle-Smith (guitar), Josh Finerty (bass), and Charlie Forbes (drums). The sound of the music the groups make is high energy with with no cool down as much as the energy just burries itself deeper within a song.
